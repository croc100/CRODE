# CRODE

**CRODE** is 100byte’s main portfolio hub — a central gateway to my work in  
**Infra · Network · Automation**.

Inspired by Supabase’s clean, minimal layout, CRODE serves as a curated space  
to introduce who I am, what I build, and how I approach real-world engineering problems.

## What is CRODE?

CRODE is not a framework, not a library, and not a public-facing service.  
It is my **personal brand site**, designed to represent:

- My background in **datacenter operations**
- My path toward becoming a **Systems / Network / DevOps Engineer**
- My philosophy of **documentation, automation, and operational clarity**
- A clean, modern front page for recruiters, collaborators, and myself

Think of CRODE as my **digital business card + technical identity**.

## Site Structure

CRODE follows a simple multi-page structure:

- **Home** — Hero, brand identity, highlights  
- **About** — Who I am, experience, interests  
- **Projects** — Overview of the systems, tools, and experiments I build  
- **Blog** — External writing hub (velog)  
- **Contact** — Channels to reach me

Each page is minimal, fast, and focused on clarity — similar to Supabase’s approach to navigation.

## What CRODE Represents

CRODE reflects the areas I focus on professionally:

### • Infrastructure  
Datacenter operations, server lifecycle, RAID, monitoring, automation.

### • Networking  
L2/L3 fundamentals, VLAN/BGP, TOR–Spine designs, CCNP-level study.

### • DevOps & Automation  
Python tooling, Django-based internal systems, Docker (air-gapped), CI/CD philosophy.

### • Documentation  
Confluence-style wiki systems, templated documentation, structured knowledge.

CRODE doesn’t expose the **details of each project**, but it links to them and presents  
the bigger picture of my engineering identity.

## Sub-Projects Linked From CRODE

CRODE acts as the entry point to my key works:

- **VCC** — IDC 출입/자산 로그 컴플라이언스 자동화 도구  
- **NetDocs** — 네트워크/IDC 문서화 시스템  
- **DoTree** — 프로젝트/작업 관리 시스템  
- **Auto Reels Factory / R2K** — 콘텐츠 자동 생성 파이프라인  
- + ongoing experiments in networking, automation, monitoring, etc.

(*These are not described in detail here — CRODE simply links to them.*)

## Design Philosophy

- Supabase-style minimal navigation  
- Dark theme + neon-green accent  
- Simple, readable, distraction-free pages  
- Emphasis on text clarity over decoration  
- Fully static Django templates (no FE complexity)

CRODE is built to be timeless and easy to maintain — just like good infra.
