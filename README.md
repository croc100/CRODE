# CRODE

**CRODE** is 100byte’s main portfolio hub — a central gateway to my work in  
**Infra · Network · Automation**.

Inspired by Supabase’s clean, minimal layout, CRODE serves as a curated space  
to introduce who I am, what I build, and how I approach real-world engineering problems.

## What is CRODE?

CRODE is not a framework, not a library, and not a public-facing service.  
It is my **personal brand site**, designed to represent:

- My background in **datacenter operations**
- My path toward becoming a **Systems / Network / DevOps Engineer**
- My philosophy of **documentation, automation, and operational clarity**
- A clean, modern front page for recruiters, collaborators, and myself

Think of CRODE as my **digital business card + technical identity**.
